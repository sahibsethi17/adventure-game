You are underneath the building, and discovered a messy kitchen. The room has the sweet aroma of vanilla frosting and there are lots of delicious pastries everywhere. A skilled chef was likely responsible for this.

Pantry
You open the door to the kitchen's pantry and wander inside. There are several ingredients that are used in baking; however, there are also several unholy rotten pastries. Maybe, the chef isn't as skilled as you thought.

Cellar
You go down a ladder underneath the trapdoor and come across a wine cellar. There are several barrels full of high quality wine. At the end of the cellar, there appears to be a hole in the wall that that seems big enough to crawl through.
