When loading the project, the file to run must be the AdventureGameApp file. This file runs the main stage for our GUI components. Note JavaFX components were used for this project. For the program to compile & run, JavaFX components must be added on the computer that the program is being run on. Also, the configurations for AdventureGameApp must be edited. To be specific, VM options must be added, with this line of code as our VM options:
--module-path "/Users/sahibsethi/Downloads/javafx-sdk-21/lib/" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
